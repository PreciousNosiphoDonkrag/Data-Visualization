# Bar graph
## What is a Bar Graph?
A bar graph is a graphical representation of categorical data using rectangular bars. The length or height of each bar corresponds to the frequency, count, or proportion of the categories being represented. Bar graphs are commonly used to compare different categories or to track changes over time.

## When to Use a Bar Graph <br>
1. Comparing Categories <br>
Bar graphs are ideal for comparing the values of different categories or groups.
They provide a visual representation of the relative sizes or proportions
of each category, making it easy to identify trends, patterns, and differences.

3. Tracking Changes Over Time <br>
When you have categorical data that varies over time or across different conditions,
 bar graphs can be used to track these changes effectively.
By plotting the data on a time axis or across different conditions,
bar graphs allow for easy comparison and interpretation of trends.

5. Displaying Ranking or Order <br>
Bar graphs are useful for displaying rankings or order among categories. By arranging the bars in descending or ascending order of frequency or value, bar graphs make it easy to identify the most and least common categories or the highest and lowest values.

6. Presenting Survey Results or Polls <br>
Bar graphs are commonly used to present survey results, polls, or categorical data from research studies. They provide a clear and concise way to communicate the findings of the study and make comparisons between different response categories.

## When Not to Use a Bar Graph
While bar graphs are versatile and widely used, there are situations where they might not be the most appropriate choice:

1. Showing Trends Over Time <br>
Bar graphs are not ideal for showing trends or changes over time
when the data points are continuous or when a continuous scale is required.

3. Representing Continuous Data <br>
When dealing with continuous data or data that can take on a large number of values, bar graphs may not effectively represent the data. Histograms or other continuous distribution plots are more appropriate for visualizing continuous data.

4. Comparing Magnitudes of Continuous Variables <br>
Bar graphs are not suitable for comparing the magnitudes of continuous variables.
In such cases, bar graphs may misrepresent the data or obscure important differences between values.

## The current Bar graph
  The data used to plot the bar graph came from a json file that has the frequency and accuracy of 
  each letter in a dataset used to predict hand written digits.

 Bar graphs are simplistic plots that allow for the comparison of data in different
 categories.
