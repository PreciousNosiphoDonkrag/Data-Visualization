# *Pie Chart*
## What is a pie chart
A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic that is divided into slices to illustrate
numerical proportions. Each slice represents a proportion of the whole, making it easy 
to compare parts to the whole.

## When to use it?
1. Showing Proportions
   Pie charts are ideal for illustrating the proportions of a whole. They are effective when you want to display
   how a certain category or group contributes to the entire dataset.
   
3. Comparing Categories
   When you have a small number of categories (ideally less than seven) and you want to compare their proportions
   relative to each other.
   
5. Highlighting Dominant Elements
   Pie charts are particularly effective at highlighting dominant elements within a dataset. If one or a few slices significantly outweigh the others,
   a pie chart can visually emphasize this dominance.

## When not to use it?
1. Too Many Categories
   If you have a large number of categories, a pie chart can become cluttered
   and difficult to read. 

3. Comparing Data Trends
   Pie charts are not suitable for showing trends over time or comparing changes
   in data, line charts are far more suitable.
   
5. Exact Data Values
   If precise data values are essential, pie charts may not be the best choice,
   as it can be challenging to accurately read the exact proportions represented by each slice.

   ##About the current Pie chart
   The food and beverage Excel file was downloaded from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB)
   website. The data was cleaned and filtered using the Panda Library. The pie chart shows the
   total income of different coffee shops for the year 2023. The coffee shops were given different
   names just for the purpose of this section.

## Final thoughts
The pie chart provides an overview perspective on the contributions of a part to a whole.
it is a useful tool, for a quick overview but not for a detailed comparison.
