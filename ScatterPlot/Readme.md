# Scatter plot
## What is a Scatter Plot?
A scatter plot is a type of plot that displays the relationship between two numerical variables by placing individual data points
on a Cartesian plane. Each data point is represented by a marker, such as a dot, and the position of the dot corresponds to the values of 
the two variables. Scatter plots are useful for visualizing patterns, trends, and correlations between variables.

# When to Use a Scatter Plot
1. Exploring Relationships <br>
Scatter plots are ideal for exploring relationships between two numerical variables.
They allow you to visually assess the direction, strength, and form of the relationship between the variables.
Common patterns observed in scatter plots include linear relationships, non-linear relationships, clusters, and outliers.

3. Detecting Correlations <br>
Scatter plots are useful for detecting correlations between variables.
By visually inspecting the scatter plot, you can identify whether the variables are positively correlated (increase together),
negatively correlated (decrease together), or not correlated at all. Correlations can provide valuable insights into the underlying
structure of the data.

5. Identifying Outliers <br>
Scatter plots help in identifying outliers, which are data points that deviate significantly from the overall pattern of the data.

## When Not to Use a Scatter Plot
1. Categorical Variables <br>
Scatter plots are not suitable for visualizing relationships between categorical variables.
In such cases, other types of plots, such as bar charts or heatmaps, may be more appropriate.

3. Large Datasets <br>
For very large datasets, scatter plots may become overcrowded and difficult to interpret.
In such cases, it may be necessary to use sampling techniques or other visualization methods to summarize the data effectively.

5. Non-Numerical Data <br>
Scatter plots are designed for visualizing relationships between numerical variables.

## The current Scatter plot
  The relationship we are attempting to view on the scatter plot is between diabetes
  progression and blood pressure. The independent variable in this care is the blood pressure.

  From the line of best fit, we see a positive correlation between these 2 variables.
  An additional scatter plot was created because I thought it was pretty:)
