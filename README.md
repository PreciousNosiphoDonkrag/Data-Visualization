# Data Visualization (DV)
The aim of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and effectively to the user, with the goal of gaining insights into the data or information.
Data visualization is a whole study on its own, and I servery under-estimated it before embarking on this learning journey./n/n

## Navigation Plan
**note: This is my own personal navigation plan, catered for me through my studies. It is not a benchmark, a standard or a suggestion for how you should navigate your data visualisation journey.**

## End goal for this section:
To create interactive (user-centric) dashboards using anyone one of the available tools (Tableau, PowerBI etc) with the aim of enhancing my data visualisation skills.

## Final thoughts:
* The hardest part about visualization is understanding the data you are working with.
