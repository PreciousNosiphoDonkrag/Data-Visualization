# Data Visualization (DV)
The aim of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and effectively to the user, with the goal of gaining insights into the data or information.
Data visualization is a whole study on its own, and I severely underestimated it before embarking on this learning journey./n/n

## Navigation Plan
**note: This is my navigation plan, catered for me through my studies. It is not a benchmark, a standard, or a suggestion for how you should navigate your data visualization journey.**

## End goal for this section:
- To understand different visualization tools and when to use each,
- To practice working with different libraries for data visualization in Python,
- To expose myself to different formats and types of data and sources. 

## What I Learned:
* The hardest part about visualization is understanding the data you are working with.
* Pie chart
    - Working with data frames from the Panda library,
    - Using functions in Panda to clean and remove any unwanted columns and rows,
    - Interestingly, I discovered that the library has a function that gives you
      summarised information about your dataset. this is ideal for new unknown           datasets. The dataset.info() gives you the following information:
      - The number of entries (rows) in each column.
      - The data type of each column.
      - The memory usage of the data frame.
      -Whether there are any non-null values in each column (missing values)
  - Another useful tool is Panda's ability to allow me to view just the column         names from my dataset. this made it easier for me to focus on columns I am         interested in.
 
 * Histogram
    - Using a readily available dataset from the SkLearn library
    - Exploring the features of the load_wine dataset
    - Adding statistical measures to the plots
    - Introduced to the scientific Python library for statistical calculations
    
 * Bar graph
    - I learned how to work with JSON files
   
* Scatter plots
  - Further exploration of the Scipy library
  - And creating esthetically pleasing plots to visualise relationships between        variables.
